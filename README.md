Main solution:

1. What is the transaction with the highest volume in the timespan
2. What is the average number of transactions per hour (would look nice like a graph)
3. What is the most favourite; selling or buying?
4. Average sale and buy price per day for the most bought currency
5. Total volume per day (graph)

We weren't told it had to be a specific dataset when we made the assignment, and I guess it's too late to change it now. I thought people got that, but I guess not, so here is what you have to do.

Also, for questions 3 and 4, we assumed you can get a csv with multiple types of transactions, and you still can, but you have to merge multiple csvs together. What you can do instead is to answer if the major trend was buying or selling for the time period, as question 3. Question 4 is the same as before, you just dont have to find which currencies were traded the most, because you have only one.


What you need to do is get an api key, and read in the documentation how to make a request to get trade data between 2 currencies for a time range, and use the option to download a csv file. The time range can be whatever you want, as long as you answer our questions for your dataset. You can go as far as you want to prove that they're true, I would recommend a basic chart.

No hard feelings if you can't finish the assignment, it's kind of our fault for the late update.

Also, if you don't manage to download a csv file, we added our example to our repo.

P.S.: try to have fun! ;)
